#### Reward Process

1. **Contract Analysis**: User analyzes a smart contract using the extension
2. **Blockchain Submission**: Analysis results are submitted to Algorand smart contract
3. **Verification**: System verifies the analysis is unique and valid
4. **Token Distribution**: ALGO tokens are automatically distributed to user's wallet
5. **Transaction Confirmation**: User receives confirmation of reward distribution

### Integration Benefits

- **Incentivized Security**: Users are rewarded for contributing to Web3 security
- **Decentralized Rewards**: No central authority controls token distribution
- **Transparent System**: All transactions are recorded on Algorand blockchain
- **Scalable Architecture**: Can handle thousands of analysis submissions

- **Documentation Issues**: Missing or unclear code comments

### Risk Assessment Algorithm

The extension uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm:

```typescript
interface RiskFacts {
  isContract: boolean;
  bytecodeSize: number;
  hasApproveMethod: boolean;
  hasTransferFrom: boolean;
  recentDeploy: boolean;
  isEOA: boolean;
}

function scoreRisk(facts: RiskFacts): number {
  let score = 0;
  if (!facts.isContract) score += 25;
  if (facts.isEOA) score += 25;
  if (facts.bytecodeSize < 2000) score += 10;
  if (facts.hasApproveMethod && facts.hasTransferFrom) score += 10;
  if (facts.recentDeploy) score += 15;
  if (facts.bytecodeSize === 0) score += 30;
  return Math.min(100, score);
}
```
